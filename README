This is a project myself and colleagues did in Project Managemnt Course (IT301)
It's about a medicine delivery application is a application that provides the ability to deliver medicines easily,
in a considerably less time and at a good price, and allows you to choose between many pharmacies and also you can communicate with the pharmacist,
delivery and track the order while you are at home and is available 24 hours to ensure the customer provides excellent and comfortable service.
